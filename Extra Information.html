<h1> Body Description<h1>
<p>
PostyBears are a breed of mechanical "guard dogs" invented by the principle of a charter school in order to patrol the halls and catch any kids skipping, any drugs, etc. These creatures were originally made to sound and look like Mr.Post from a distance in order for students to not get suspicious. These creatures were also made to do anouncements, however instead of having a working bottom jaw they are able to unlatch their top jaw from the bottom one and release noise and eat things. Posty Bears simply were made to create a better, stricter and safer school environment until things went drastically wrong. They are approximately the size of a human head with six long spindley legs used o climb walls and latch onto prey/students. They have toes that are adapted to be able to hook their flesh on walls in order to climb them.

<h1> Reproductive Habits </h1>
<p>
PostyBears have a very unique reproductive habit. Their is two breeds of PostyBears in their seperate societys. N-pods and R-pods, R-Pods are the ones who are able to reproduce and N-Pods are mainly the workers and food for the hatclings. There is one, very large, PostyBear who is the mother of them all. It is approximately 15ft tall and 30ft wide when it is sponged up in it's burrow. This mother consumes the dying PostyBears in order to gain all of the adaptive qualities which helps keep it alive and strong. This is presumably the reason Mr.Post never returned that fateful day. R-Pods lay eggs in the vents in a sticky red slime that feeds the hatchlings until they are big enough to eat their way out of the sack. These egg sacks are extremely dangerous to the human, they burn the flesh like acid and tend to combust into flames if they get water on them. PostyBears are a-sexual meaning they reproduce by themselves naturally.

Posty Bears are not any normal robotic take over aliens, they have interesting breeding habits and the location they hide out in is a strange one. However, the strangest thing about them is their dietary activities based on the type of creature you are encountering.<br>
