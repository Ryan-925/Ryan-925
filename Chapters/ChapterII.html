<h1>Chapter II</h1>
<p>
	My Face fell in shadow as the creaking of the vents got louder. My arm bent backwards slowly and silently, grasping the handle of the school-made crossbow as I kept my eyes locked on the opening in front of use. The vent barrier had been torn to shreds and many Posty-Bears lay dead on the ground in a puddle of their own oily black blood. The metal wires and scrap that had once been obvious only poked out from their versatile flesh where their metal bones had  been broken.
</p>
<p>
	In a hushed whisper,
 <blockquote>
“Once we clear this area and re-seal the vent I want half of you to stay and collect scraps from this war scene. Once your bags are full, return to camp and you can exchange the scraps for your money today.”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	Many of the coins and scrap we collect become our own currency which we use to separate the communities within our base. Many coins are used for the troops when they trade in scrap for a coin, then we use the vending machines for people to distribute snacks. Many occupants fight over money they find on the ground which the higher classes watch from the top of the scaffold. There is hardly any running water we can use as our base gets smaller and smaller each time the barriers are breached. Many students are caked in dirt and oil from their battles outside the comfort of the theater. 
</p>
<p>
	The vent began to wobble aggressively as the creatures grew closer to the exit. Suddenly a large crashing of metal echoed around the room as the vent ending broke off from the belts that were once meant to keep kids out, eventually slowing the monsters from getting in. Large spider-like creatures with the head of the principle equipped with a bear nose and ears having evolved to better track students and hear where people are. Fear rushed through my limbs as every hair on my neck and arms stood on end. My muscles rippled as my grip tightened on the crossbow on my back. Fifteen large Bears crowded around the exit of the vent looking around to find their prey. My eyes met with the shining orbs of the leader of this group and a large mechanic screech filled the air, echoing through the vents causing the sound to last longer.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
	“ATTACK!”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
A singular word left my mouth as I yelled for my men to protect our base. My feet pushed off the carpet floor as I careened forward, allowing me to get a large amount of force to kick the smallest of the group in order to stall just enough time to grab my dagger. The noise of crossbows being loaded caused my heart to skip a beat. My men will stay back and shoot at the creatures with their crossbows and throw the bombs in the middle of the space we are battling in. I however use my dagger to destract the creatures in order for less people to get hurt or even have a chance of dying. I felt my skin tear along the exposed parts of my arms and legs. The nails of these fleshy bots are easily able to slice through skin. Many of the troops refuse to go into one on one battle with these creatures due to the lack of knowledge about their anatomy. Many of us assume they are merely mechanical, however the more we battle them and the more information we collect from their remains leads us to believe they are merely flesh with a metal endoskeleton allowing them to move and fit through small spaces. But we have no idea how or why they came to be the apocalyptic beats they are today.

	The last of the barrier was put up and the scraps from the creatures were stuffed clumsily into our satchels as we began to clear the area. One man would be left on guard and would be required to frequently update about the situation. However, with all of the recent breaches in security I have decided we will leave another trooper with him in order to ward off any beasts long enough for an actual troop to arrive.
</p>
<p>
	My footsteps echoed as I led my troo back to alert everyone to be on extra guard especially around the borders in case we get another breach in our security.

<blockquote>
“Where’s Vic?”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
 I asked David as he was the general on duty for the time being.
</p>
<p>
“He went to check the cameras to see if it’s safe to expand our borders in case of another breach.”
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
“He does realize that if we expand our borders after an incident like this we will not only look like fools but we will risk the safety of our troops and civilians which could lead to many, if not all of our demise.”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
“I know sir, but he refuses to take no for an answer. He wants more territory and an excuse to continue to exterminate the posty-bears in hopes of finding their lair.”
