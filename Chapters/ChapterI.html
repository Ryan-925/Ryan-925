<h1>Chapter I</h1>

	Feet pounded down the hall as the pages of the notebook wrinkled and folded in the wind. The tall, muscular student rushed back to the safety of the catwalks as porty-bears crowded behind them. Flowing almost like water through the halls, tumbling one after the other. Screams of terror and battle cries filled the vent systems. Doors and windows were boarded up so only slivers of light could flood into the dark rooms. Fires blazed outside as monsters crashed around consuming and kidnapping anyone in their paths. The student rushed through a crowd of people banging and crying as the doors stood tall and locked. The glass only shivered slightly with the punches thrown. Terror filled their eyes as truth came to ligh. They would be stuck here, with those monsters and no safe way out.

	Shadows filled the room as his eyes adapted to the dark. The view down into their base was a sight to behold. Vending machines filled with food and weapons, the surrounding area of what once was the theater became home to the entertainment for the two generals trusted with the lives of everyone at their mercy. A slight grin grew on the tattered man's face as he watched what he and his partner had created. Victor conducted the roles of generals and groups while Kage led them into battle and charged the group's journey to collect rations. No one knew just how much time had gone by in the outside world as electricity and the internet had run out. The only thing we knew was it was not safe anywhere in America. Posty-bears had spread quickly, causing casualties and claiming any sort of land they could get their hands on. Food rations in the kitchen of the school was running low meaning we would eventually have to leave to collect nutrients from somewhere else.

	The sky was a pale gray with red clouds and black smoke reflecting the light of fires and consuming the sound of anyone's screams for help. Many never left the building without gas masks and bags full of bandages and cleaning supplies. Fear consumed the hearts of the remaining students and staff as Mr. Post had yet to return from the many days within the vent system. It seems the creatures have grown larger and more aggressive the longer they were in control. The school had once been a beautiful building filled with adoring students learning art and science and continuing their highschool educations. The moment students began to realize the announcements and SIS system were no normal production was the moment these things began revealing themselves.

Kage gazed over the warriors as they fought for food and battled for money. Victor and him had created a utopia with the surviving students in the school. Many months at least had passed since Post disappeared and these things took over. Many students and staff were lost to the claws of them. These creatures may have been a danger to our safety but they were also a way to punish the ones who betrayed our reliable system. Anyone who survived an attack or punishment from these Posty-Bears had fear implanted in their heart and had since become a very reliable general. Many of the surviving teachers were tasked with creating new weapons and plans to attack and defeat these horrendous beings. Mr. Croshaw had been in charge of our weaponry since day one. Around the beginning of these attacks we had learned one of the Posty-bears weaknesses. We since have relied on troops to go and retrieve Monsters and other energy drinks from abandoned stores and gas stations. Croshaw was then tasked to create a dangerous chemical compound to make these cans explode when shaken at high velocities and thrown. Luckily we eventually found a compound safe for humans but still fatal for Posty-Bears.
