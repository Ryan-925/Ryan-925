<h1>What Are they?</h1>
<p>
Posty Bears are a fictional series of mythical creatures and events based on multiple encounters with our principal here at Davinci Academy of the Science and Arts. These events will be linked to the prequel that a very good friend of mine is making. (Link to Abbyâ€™s Site)

<h2>Imagery</h2>
<p>
Posty Bears are a breed mixed with the robotic spider body from Toy Story with the head of our principle, bear ears for good hearing and a bear nose for the enhanced smell.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p2>
These events are fully fictional and are not meant to cause any offense to any of the people within this story. We would like to credit Mr. Post with the original reference due to the encounters we have had with him. The idea stemmed from a joke between me and a friend of mine, Isabella Samaro, in our Language Arts class. This story may have some gore and graphic content so do not read if you are sensitive to any of that. There will be no strong language and not much blood and gore or death. There will just be disturbing details of apocalyptic settings, nests of student hair and nails, dietary restrictions for the Posty Bears, and the details of the egg sacks that the offspring grow in for 9 months. These creatures reproduce a-sexually so there will be no adult content.
