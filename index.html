<h1>What Are they?</h1>
<p>
Posty Bears are a fictional series of mythical creatures and events based on multiple encounters with our principal here at Davinci Academy of the Science and Arts. These events will be linked to the prequel that a very good friend of mine is making. (Link to Abbyâ€™s Site)

Posty Bears are a breed mixed with the robotic spider body from Toy Story with the head of our principle, bear ears for good hearing and a bear nose for the enhanced smell.
